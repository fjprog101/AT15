# Unit Testing

Use this folder to add unit tests for your implementation code. Folders must follow the same structure under `main/` folder and packages should be the same as the ones defined for implementation classes.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test driven development is a technique where we start implementing the test first, and then the actual implementation to be tested.
It consists of the following steps:

1. Add a test
2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
4. All tests should now pass
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved
